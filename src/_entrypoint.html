src/_entrypoint.html

This is the Parcel entrypoint file. It should have a link/script tag for each asset
which your src/components/shared/layout_head.cr references.

The true entrypoint into your application is your src/pages/layout, but that's not
available to parcel in a way that parcel can understand. This is a cheap hack to
inform parcel of the files that need to be added to the bundles.
